# 🎓 Student Management Form — C# Windows Forms Project  
A form-based app for registering students, displaying their info, and calculating class averages.  
Built during my journey into interactive programming, UI design, and event-driven logic ✨

## 💡 What it does  
Students enter their name, ID, and grade into the form  
Teachers can view the full student list or calculate the average grade  
All data is validated before being added to ensure clean and accurate input  

## 🔐 Input Conditions and App Logic  
✔️ All fields must be filled in before saving  
✔️ Duplicate students (based on ID) cannot be added  
✔️ Maximum of 10 students are allowed — adding more shows an error message  
✔️ The student list can be viewed anytime by clicking "View Students List"  
✔️ Clicking "Class Average" calculates and displays the average grade of all students  

## 🎯 Why it matters  
This project helped me understand how to create form-based applications using C#  
It blends logic, user experience, and visual structure into a complete app  
A great practice in building structured code, validating input, and designing user flows
